CA-MRSA Hotspot and Disease Risk Map/Spatial Autocorrelation Analysis in California.

This papers's *aim* is to estimate CA-MRSA risk in California across the years 2016-2019. This paper identified areas in California that are high CA-MRSA and low CA-MRSA infection areas, and model the small-area relative risk of infection, spatial variation, and incidence of CA-MRSA in California.

This papers's *objectives* are as follows:

1.  Calculate the observed and expected disease cases
2.  Map disease risk estimates: Age-Standardized Infection Ratios (SIR)
3.  Detect clusters using local and global spatial autocorrelation
4.  Improve local estimates for areas with small populations by using a model-based approach that smooths extreme values based on small sample sizes and borrow information from neighbors to improve estimates (R-INLA)

*The population denominator for this paper is from the 2019 American Community Survey Estimates*

## data
This analysis requires ecological data of CA-MRSA infection incidence in California medical service study areas (MSSA) and age-standardized infection rates across California MSSAs. As the data for this paper was obtained from California's Department of Health Care Access and Information and is not publicly available, no data can be made available. HCAi datasets can be downloaded or requested: https://hcai.ca.gov/data-and-reports/
